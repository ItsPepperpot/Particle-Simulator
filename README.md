# A particle simulator for HTML5 canvas.
## Description
A 2D particle simulator with support for elastic collisions, particle path drawing, simulated gravity and random (Brownian) motion.
## Future Improvements
- Add time-based physics simulation instead of frame-based âœ”
- Add quadtree algorithm for interparticle collisions
- Simulate physics independently of frame-rate
- Add gravitational force between particles
